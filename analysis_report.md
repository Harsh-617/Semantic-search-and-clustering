# Final Synthesis and Conclusion
## 1. Quantitative Evaluation (Silhouette Scores)

The Silhouette Score provides an objective measure of cluster separation quality, ranging from âˆ’1 (poorly defined) to +1 (well-separated).

| Model        | Silhouette Score |
|---------------|------------------|
| **TF-IDF**    | 0.0027           |
| **Embeddings**| 0.0291           |

### Interpretation:
Although both scores are relatively low (as expected with high-dimensional text data), the Embeddings model achieves a noticeably higher score, suggesting that its clusters are more internally consistent and better separated.
This provides clear quantitative evidence that semantic representations lead to improved clustering quality.


## 2. Qualitative Evaluation (Cluster Coherence & Visualization)

### TF-IDF Model:
- Produced clusters that were keyword-based, focusing on literal word overlap.
- Some clusters showed thematic redundancy or overlap, since different topics can share similar vocabulary.
- PCA/SVD visualizations indicated less distinct cluster boundaries.

### Embeddings Model:
- Captured semantic relationships between documents, forming clusters based on contextual meaning rather than specific word matches.
- Visual inspection revealed more distinct and compact cluster regions, indicating better separation.
- Cluster names derived from this model were conceptually broader and more meaningful, improving interpretability.

### Verdict: The Embeddings approach provides superior qualitative coherence and clearer thematic organization compared to TF-IDF.


## 3. Retrieval Effectiveness (Contextual Understanding)

When applied to document retrieval tasks, both models perform adequately for matching relevant content.
However:

- TF-IDF is effective for exact keyword searches, where precision on word matching is crucial.

- Embeddings excel in semantic retrieval, identifying conceptually related documents even when query words differ.

### Interpretation: This shows that Embeddings are better suited for real-world search systems where users may phrase queries naturally or contextually.


## 4. Final Evaluation and Insights

| **Evaluation Aspect**       | **Superior Model** | **Reason**                                           |
|------------------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Quantitative Cluster Quality | **Embeddings**     | Higher Silhouette Score                              |
| Topic Coherence              | **Embeddings**     | Captures meaning beyond word frequency               |
| Visual Separation            | **Embeddings**     | More distinct clusters in reduced dimensions         |
| Retrieval Context            | **Embeddings**     | Handles semantic understanding effectively           |


## Final Conclusion:
Across all dimensions - clustering quality, thematic coherence, and retrieval capability - the Embedding-based approach demonstrates clear superiority.
While TF-IDF remains a strong baseline for lexical similarity, Embeddings provide a richer, more human-like understanding of textual relationships, making them the preferred choice for modern document analysis and information retrieval systems.
